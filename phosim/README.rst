Phosim pipeline for the DESC community
--------------------------------------

The Phosim application is a fast monte-carlo style photon simulator that takes into account atmospheric physics, 
telescope and camera to simulate astronomical images. The pipeline orchestrates the creation of the initial setup 
files, launches several visits, creates trim instance catalogs, and simulates photons received by sensors.

The pipeline currently only describes the pipeline flow and does not invoke the actual `phosim<https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home>`_ codes.

State : In development.
